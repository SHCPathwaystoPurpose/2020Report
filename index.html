         <h2>Student Learning Outcomes</h2>
  Create a culture of vocational discernment at Spring Hill College where students have opportunities to:<br><br>
      <p><strong style="color:#f9a11b">Student Learning Outcome 1:</strong>  Ask and explore fundamental questions of vocation</p>
          <p><strong style="color:#039691">Student Learning Outcome 2:</strong> Integrate and make sense of those moments during their college experience when they felt called, purposeful, or inspired</p>
          <p><strong style="color:#ef4b24">Student Learning Outcome 3:</strong> Demonstrate an understanding that vocational discernment is an ongoing process</p>
         
    <br>

            <p>The Quality Enhancement Plan attempts to provide a four year developmental model where students deepen their discernment of vocation and purpose over the course of their college experience. Essays are rated at three points during their college career. The data below shows a development growth in discernment of vocation as students progress through college. <a href="http://pathways.shc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/VocationalDiscernmentRubric.pdf">All ratings are out of 5</a>.</p>

Pathways to Purpose activities include all Guidebook activities as well as promotional or outreach events such as Vocation Lunches and Leadership Workshops.</p></div></div>

  <p>The Pathways to Purpose Guidebook outlines four years of developmental vocational discernment and purpose exploration for students based upon best practices shared by students, staff, and faculty. All first year students are given a physical version of the Guidebook to use throughout their time at SHC, additionally an online Guidebook is available through Schoology, the College's Learning Management System.</p>
             <p>The Guidebook provides an outline of the ways to get involved in Pathways to Purpose. Many of the in-person sign-ins of the Guidebook are also reflected in other Pathways to Purpose activities, such as the student retreats and the Sophomore Dinner.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Two students completed the Guidebook in 2020 receiving stoles. Congratulations to <strong>Kourtney Harrell, '20</strong> and <strong>Meisha White, '20</strong>

  <h2>Curriculum</h2>
  <br>
  <p>Any faculty member has the opprotunity to integrate vocational discernment discussions or activities into their course. The intent is that students will make additional connections between their own sense of vocation and the learning being done in the classroom. Classes are offered across a variety of divisions and are often associated with sophomore-level core courses.
